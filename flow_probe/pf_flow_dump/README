PF_Ring based dumping analysis tool: userland/examples/pfflowdump

To build and install, just run:
$ make & sudo make install

Then, run the following command:
$ sudo pfflowdump -i eth1 -l 80 -m -v 1 -f "tcp port 5001"
(only IPv4 TCP is supported currently, and change interface -i and BPF filter -f as needed)

Note that, the pf_ring kernel module may need to be installed first:
$ cd kernel & sudo insmod pf_ring.ko

Besides, a simple collector implementation (collector.c) is provided as a sample
to start with. It accepts exporter connection on a given port, and receives the
exported flow messages. To build it, just run:
$ gcc -o collector collector.c
